The key is used to look up the associated value, and each key must be unique within the dictionary. A dictionary is composed of keys and their corresponding values. Under the hood, Python dictionaries use a hash table to store data. Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections (prior to Python 3.7).

This immutability is a key characteristic of strings in Python and serves several purposes in the language design, with performance, safety, and consistency being some of the most important reasons. Immutable strings can be safely shared across multiple threads without risk of modification. Since strings can’t be changed, you don’t have to worry about unexpected side effects."],"metadata":{"id":"uIwL24KyuQgM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q. 10 Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","\n","->> In Python, a tuple would be preferable over a list in scenarios where immutability (the ability to ensure that the data cannot be changed) is important.

When you try to add a duplicate value to a set, it simply ignores the new value and does not add it. A set only contains unique elements, so any repeated elements are automatically discarded."],"metadata":{"id":"D3xG6yRmuQlS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q. 12 How does the \"in\" keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","\n","->> The in keyword is used in both lists and dictionaries in Python to check for membership, but it works differently depending on the data structure. When used with a list, the in keyword checks if a specific element exists in the list. When used with a dictionary, the in keyword checks if a key exists in the dictionary, not the value.

To retrieve a value from a dictionary, you use the key associated with that value.
